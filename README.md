math.fmod(x,y)

 * Input: Two real numbers x & y, y â‰  0
 * Return Type: Floating-point number
  
This function takes two numbers as input and returns the floating remainder when x is divided by y. By floating-point remainder, we mean that the result is a number r = x - n*y for some integer n such that r has the same sign as the sign of x and the absolute value of r is less than the absolute value of y.

solution:

     2.0
